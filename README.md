### Sidenote: Please read at least the last half of the readme if you are using versions 1.0 or lower, or you'll probably regret it later (It's not that long).

This is a project that solves mathematic equations for you!

Types:

1. Quadratic
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.quadsolve()***
      > To type a square in python, you need to use a carrot **^** or two astrix **. (Ex. 2x^2 -5x +4)

2. Slope Intercept
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.slopeint()***
      > Put in two points, and output an equation in slope-intercept form.

Types in Development (Not included in the package, but will probably be on github.):

1. Perpendicular Lines
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.perpint()***
      > Put in the slope of a line, and the intersection point, and get the slope-intercept equation of the perpendicular line.

2. Midpoint
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.midpoint()***
      > Gives you the midpoint of two points.

Other Commands:

1. Command List
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.commands()***

2. Help
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.help()***


## Version Info:

#### V0.1.5.9 and before:
  - Don't even try to use these. They don't do anything...

#### V0.1.6 - V0.2:
  - You can actually import everything correctly now without errors!!

#### V1.0:
  - First official release.
  - Contains quadratic and slope-intercept equation solvers.

#### V1.1:
  - You dont have to do any weird importing anymore! ***import eqsolvcarlover101*** works!!!

#### V1.1.1 - V1.1.2:
  - I just forgot to update the readme correctly. The code is the exact same.

## Helpful Info:

- When importing the package, if you are using versions 1.0 or lower, use ***import eqsolvcarlover101.equation*** instead because I haven't figured out how to make it so you don't have to do that yet. It just doesn't work otherwise.

## Thanks to all for using my work!
