# Equation-Solver - Thank you for 25,000 downloads!!!

## Update: Sorry for no new stuff or updates! I've been gone for a while out of the country on a mission trip. I'm back now and should be back to fairly regular updates.

### Sidenote: Please read at least the last half of the readme if you are using versions 1.0 or lower, or you'll probably regret it later (It's not that long).

This is a project that solves mathematic equations for you!

Types:

1. Quadratic
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.quadsolve()***
      > To type a square in python, you need to use a carrot **^** or two astrix **. (Ex. 2x^2 -5x +4)

2. Slope Intercept
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.slopeint()***
      > Put in two points, and output an equation in slope-intercept form.

3. Midpoint
    - _**eqsolvcarlover101.midpoint()**_
      > Put in two points and output the midpoint.

4. Perpendicular Lines
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.perpint()***
      > Put in the slope of a line, and the intersection point, and get the slope-intercept equation of the perpendicular line.

5. Similar Shapes Check
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.issim()***
      > Takes the lengths of the sides of one shape and the corresponding side lengths of the sides of a second shape.
      > 
      > If the shapes are similar, it will return the scale factor.

6. Missing Right Triangle Lengths
   - ***eqsolvcarlover101.findright()***
     > Finds the missing length of a right triangle.

Other Commands:

1. Command List
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.commands()***

2. Help
    - ***eqsolvcarlover101.help()***


## Version Info:

#### V0.1.5.9 and before:
  - Don't even try to use these. They don't do anything...

#### V0.1.6 - V0.2:
  - You can actually import everything correctly now without errors!!

#### V1.0:
  - First official release.
  - Contains quadratic and slope-intercept equation solvers.

#### V1.1:
  - You dont have to do any weird importing anymore! ***import eqsolvcarlover101*** works!!!

#### V1.1.1 - V1.1.2:
  - I just forgot to update the readme correctly. The code is the exact same.

#### V1.1.3
  - License and Readme updates.

#### V1.1.4
  - Python version requirement updates.

#### V1.1.5
  - Includes link to new documentation and some readme updates.

#### V1.2
  - Added _**eqsolvcarlover101.midpoint()**_.

#### V1.2.1
  - Updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ and _**eqsolvcarlover101.help()**_ functions.

#### V1.3
  - Added the _**eqsolvcarlover101.perpint()**_ function and updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.3.1
  - Fixed an issue with the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.4
  - Added the _**eqsolvcarlover101.issim()**_ function and updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.5
  - Added the eqsolvcarlover101.findright() function and updated the eqsolvcarlover101.commands() function.
#### V1.5.1.0
  - Changed the package name from eqsolvcarlover101 to eqsolve.
  - Updated the eqsolve.commands() function.
  - Updated the eqsolve.help() function.
  - Fixed a text error in the eqsolve.issim() function.
  - Updated README.MD.
  - Updated package description.

### Helpful Info:
  - When importing the package, if you are using versions 1.0 or lower, use import eqsolvcarlover101.equation instead because I hadn't figured out how to make it so you didn't have to do that yet. It just doesn't work otherwise.
  - If you are using versions 1.1 - 1.5.1, then you cannot use import eqsolve.*, instead use import eqsolvcarlover101.*.
Thanks to all for using my work!
