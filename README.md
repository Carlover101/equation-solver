This is a project that solves mathematic equations for you!


# How to Install:

1. Make sure you have Python installed by typing `python3` in the command prompt.
   > If not, go to [python.org](https://python.org) to get the latest release.

2. Enter `pip install eqsolve`.

3. Use `import eqsolve` in your code to begin using the package.

#


## Functions:

1. Quadratic
    - ***eqsolve.quadsolve()***
      > To type a square in python, you need to use a carrot **^** or two astrix **. (Ex. 2x^2 -5x +4)

2. Slope Intercept
    - ***eqsolve.slopeint()***
      > Put in two points, and output an equation in slope-intercept form.

3. Midpoint
    - _**eqsolve.midpoint()**_
      > Put in two points and output the midpoint.

4. Perpendicular Lines
    - ***eqsolve.perpint()***
      > Put in the slope of a line, and the intersection point, and get the slope-intercept equation of the perpendicular line.

5. Similar Shapes Check
    - ***eqsolve.issim()***
      > Takes the lengths of the sides of one shape and the corresponding side lengths of the sides of a second shape.
      > If the shapes are similar, it will return the scale factor.

6. Missing Right Triangle Lengths
   - ***eqsolve.findright()***
     > Finds the missing length of a right triangle.

7. Compounding Intersest
   - ***eqsolve.intcompound(p,r,n,t)***
     > Calculates the amount of money present/money owed after a number of years using the provided interest rate and the number of times it is compounded yearly.

8. Continuously Compounding Interest
   - ***eqsolve.contcompound(p,r,t)***
     > Calculates the amount of money present/money owed after a number of years if the interest provided is compounded continuously.

### Other Commands:

1. Command List
    - ***eqsolve.commands()***

2. Help
    - ***eqsolve.help()***

## Version Info (eqsolvcarlover101):

#### V0.1.5.9 and before:

  - First official release.
  - Contains quadratic and slope-intercept equation solvers.

#### V1.1:
  - You dont have to do any weird importing anymore! ***import eqsolvcarlover101*** works!!!

#### V1.1.1 - V1.1.2:
  - I just forgot to update the readme correctly. The code is the exact same.

#### V1.1.3
  - License and Readme updates.

#### V1.1.4
  - Python version requirement updates.

#### V1.1.5
  - Includes link to new documentation and some readme updates.

#### V1.2
  - Added _**eqsolvcarlover101.midpoint()**_.

#### V1.2.1
  - Updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ and _**eqsolvcarlover101.help()**_ functions.

#### V1.3
  - Added the _**eqsolvcarlover101.perpint()**_ function and updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.3.1
  - Fixed an issue with the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.4
  - Added the _**eqsolvcarlover101.issim()**_ function and updated the _**eqsolvcarlover101.commands()**_ function.

#### V1.5
  - Added the eqsolvcarlover101.findright() function and updated the eqsolvcarlover101.commands() function.
#### V1.5.1.0
  - Changed the package name from eqsolvcarlover101 to eqsolve.
  - Updated the eqsolve.commands() function.
  - Updated the eqsolve.help() function.
  - Fixed a text error in the eqsolve.issim() function.
  - Updated README.MD.
  - Updated package description.

## Version Info (eqsolve):

#### V1.0.0
    - Added _**eqsolve.intcompound()**_ and _**eqsolve.contcompound()**_ functions.
    - Updated all function descriptions so they work with python's default ***help(...)*** function.
    - Updated all functions to move away from ***input()*** towards proper function notation.
    - Updated **README.md** so it reflects current statistics and project version info.

#### V1.0.1
    - Fixed some errors in the **README.md** file.


### Helpful Info:
  - When importing the package, if you are using versions 1.0 or lower, use import eqsolvcarlover101.equation instead because I hadn't figured out how to make it so you didn't have to do that yet. It just doesn't work otherwise.
  - If you are using versions 1.1 - 1.5.1, then you cannot use import eqsolve.*, instead use import eqsolvcarlover101.*.

### Thanks for using my work!
